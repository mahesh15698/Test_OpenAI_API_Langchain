It involves teaching machines to recognize patterns and make decisions based on the data they are given, and then improve their performance over time through experience. This enables machines to perform tasks and make predictions or decisions without explicit instructions from humans. Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including predictive analytics, natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. \n"
